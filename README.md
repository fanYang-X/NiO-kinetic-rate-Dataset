# NiO-kinetic-rate-Dataset

#### NiO data retrieved from the literature are provided, with the experimental condition set as isothermal oxidation. The data features include oxidation temperature, nominal alloy composition, and activity characteristics calculated via Thermo-Calc, as well as the label, i.e., the NiO rate constant \(K_p\).
